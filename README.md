### highseas

## What is this repo ? 

It's just a working version of [`highseas repo`](https://github.com/Nostrorom/highseas), the issue had to do with the `polka` version for Heroku. Downgraded to latest stable release. 

The app is deployed at: [`highseas`](https://high-seas.herokuapp.com/) which will remain as is.

Further development as a personal project will happen in the [`stormyweather`](https://github.com/Nostrorom/highseas) repo, with the app deployed here: [`highseas`](https://stormy-weathers.herokuapp.com/).
